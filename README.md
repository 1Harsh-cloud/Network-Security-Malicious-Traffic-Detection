🔐 Paper 3: Revolutionizing Network Security – Stacked Generalization for Malicious Traffic Detection
📍 Published in: IEEE Conference Proceedings (Submitted)
📊 Dataset Used: CIC-IDS2017 (2.8M labeled traffic records)

📌 Abstract
This paper addresses the inadequacy of traditional network security mechanisms in detecting modern cyber threats. It introduces a stacked generalization ensemble framework combining Random Forest and XGBoost with a Logistic Regression meta-learner to improve detection of cyber threats.

🧩 Key Contributions
Designed a robust three-tier model: Random Forest + XGBoost → Logistic Regression.

Achieved 99.5% accuracy, outperforming standalone ML models.

Addressed challenges like imbalanced datasets using SMOTE, feature engineering, and normalization.
